Appliances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Bulb - 4 to 9 watts enough, golden yellow color light, use white color light outside or bathroom but not living room, bed room...white emits UV...can damage eyes


fan - 30 to 40 watts, bldc motor fans

stove - wood fire, infrared cooker (heating coil) not induction cooker(magnetism)

water purifier - live near river drink direct, well water drink direct....never use RO - its equivalent to distilled water used in big batteries and has nothing in it, no minerals

1 star = very high consumption, highest bill, lowest efficincy
2
3
4
5 star = very low consumption, lowest bill, highest efficincy

refridgerator =  200 liters 5 star inverter fridge

ac = is it really required, 1.5 ton 5 star dual inverter portable ac, if dual inverter is expensive now if not availiable can by single inverter not much difference 

washing machine = 8 kg, 5 star inverter automatic with hot water feature, dont buy dryer, or inbuit dryer(use rare) for rainy days ...sun dry is best 

dishwasher = 5 star inverter


On spot power generation recomended (transmission lines are very inefficient more than half the power is lost is hysterisis only)
--------------------------
solar panel = 500 w * 2 (life = 25 years)
solar inverter with wifi phone app = 4 kw (life = depends)
battery = lead battery (not good but for now until hydrogen fuel cell is availiable) (life = 10 years if lucky)
