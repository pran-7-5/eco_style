Cast iron Mortal and pestle (stone, wooden should be avoided due to breakage) 

Dough mixing bowl

** aluminium, steel, stainless steel, copper, plastic, tin, ceramic, non stick Teflon utensils should be avoided, but why ? becasuse = metals have leaching properties, can enter central nervous system, aluminium and copper turns to AlO3 and CuSO4. ceramic has paint.
```

Packaging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Clay and leaf is recommend


**Plastic packaging should be avoided(aluminum is slightly better than plastic but still it should be avoided) 
```

teeth cleaning

'Makeup'
=======
Nail polish (ancient alta was used for mehndi, lipstick and blush) but are not available today in markets but can be homemade. 
 alta available in market is fake, made of chemical whereas ancient alta was made from raw sugar or paan leaf either one, not sure needs more research

**Coloring hair tip will also soak NH3-ammonia compounds in hair color into skin

Color- light color

**dark color clothes should be worn if temperature is below 25 degree celsius and low humidity

** elastane, spandex, linen, polyester, should be avoided

hygiene= reusable cotton pads (normal is ok for outside purposes but creating pollution)

protection = non lubricated condoms (example brand = trojan)(lubricated = chemical)

```

Drinks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Ganja/bhang (can cure all diseases, it has no side effects or overdose) 

Opium (can cure all diseases but it has overdose so caution is required)

Well a disease is an idea, I had panic attack 4 times well nothing serious. But I made the same mistake 4 times over excitement... The thing is there is a sequence... U can smoke pot first and then drink alcohol and then smoke again if u want.... 

But if you drink first and then smoke pot... Then you will get a panic attack, well nothing serious just sleep for 1 hr on the spot... Every thing will get normal... Max you will get unconscious

The reason is thc is stronger than alcohol... That means if you smoke first then alcohol will not have effect... 

It is like you eat the less sweet first and then the more sweet item

hemp ciggarette can replace the nicotine(hemp has very low THC than mariju)

**Never use ciggarette(carcinogenic), cocaine (these are synthetic, inorganic, lab made, lots of chemical
```

Cooking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
never eat too much at once, eat less but 4 times and if not feeling hungry reduce the previous meal next time ...

cooking time = 15 - 20 minutes MAX, I live at sea level (might need more in few areas like norway or himalayas altitude affects the pressure, population density is low , so no problem)

procedure
-----------
rice and dishes
_______________________
oil(fat) goes first 
spices if required
veges or rice
close lid 
boil it 15 mins until done, dont open the lid yet
fine tuneing the technique, after few rounds you will get the idea

world cooks bread well no need to specify.

Appliances

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
LED Bulb - 4 watts (study room) to 9 watts(outside) enough, golden yellow color light, use white color light outside or bathroom but not living room, bed room...white emits UV...can damage eyes = 1 USD max(availiable all around the world)


BLDC fan - 30 to 40 watts, bldc motor fans = 30 USD max(availiable all around the world)

stove - wood fire, cast iron hot plate cooker(heating coil inside) by solar.... not induction cooker(magnetism) = 20 USD max(availiable all around the world)

water purifier - live near river drink direct, well water drink direct(not steady wells/only stream wells)....never use RO - its equivalent to distilled water used in big batteries and has nothing in it, no minerals

1 star = very high consumption, highest bill, lowest efficincy
2
3
4
5 star = very low consumption, lowest bill, highest efficincy

refridgerator(100w) =  200 liters 5 star inverter fridge = 200 USD max

ac(500w) = is it really required, 1.5 ton 5 star dual inverter portable ac, if dual inverter is expensive now if not availiable can by single inverter not much difference  = 600 USD max(availiable all around the world)

[https://www.amazon.in/dp/B084LGQKD7/?coliid=I2BFB5UG6QLVLQ&colid=1IDYXFOGSKWFV&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it]
washing machine(300w) = 8 kg, 5 star inverter automatic with hot water feature, dont buy dryer, or inbuit dryer(use rare) for rainy days ...sun dry is best  = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)

dishwasher(200w) = 5 star inverter = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)


On spot power generation recomended (transmission lines are very inefficient more than half the power is lost is hysterisis only)
--------------------------
solar panel = mono perc [500 w] (life = 25 years) = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)(might require 2 panels in low sunlight areas like norway)
solar inverter with wifi phone app = [4 kw] (life = depends) = 200 USD max(availiable all around the world)
battery = lead battery[300Ah] (not good but for now until hydrogen fuel cell is availiable) (life = 10 years if lucky) = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)

internet = starlink(availiable)(expensive), oneweb(low price)(wait for launch soon)(no separate dish, cable tv or anything required)

bluetooth speaker = apple home/alexa studio/sony srs-xb43 for music, phone speakers will be enough in the future, the tech already exist but profit coming in the way, just need four drivers 

phone + tab + pc in one device = samsung/microsoft rollable phone (coming soon)(reduction of electronic waste)

security camera = your own country brands, just infrared vision for night, free cloud storage for a week atleast for crime detection, but the data center needs to be secure and in the same country 

door lock = design change required by replacing steel with carbon fiber or flax fiber

tv = well tv uses a lot of plastic, portable laser Projector are future = anker capsule similar

best car in the world = cheapest ev availiable(citroen e-c3) = 15000 USD max (till 2023)(well ev solar charging would require 1 more solar panel addition to avove calculation)

best car is toyota mirai but very expensive write now, coz its life span is 150 years, it is called a forever car.
```


House construction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
never build cement house(especially those who live near earthquake zones)

wood and mud combined houses are best and you will be so happy

well ancient stucture like rome and temples of india are made of (lime mortar) it is a natural ecofriendly cement made from baked sea shells picked and collected from sea shore

bricks = baked is solar powered furnace

todays cement = modern cement = the CaCO3 is obtained by mining

every person should get his own room in a family (not a small room, mind needs more room to grow), but smallest bathroom possible

Ban on Fences are important- wire, metal, wall, wood should be avoided... Can plant trees only
```


Mineral mines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
satellite land allocatiion, same for each person

shutdown all types of power plants. homes in cities can be power by solar just 1 panel is required for one home. already availiable.

stop diging mines = we dont need metals anymore = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber parts are used now and more efficient and light weight

stop constructing new roads, bridges, new ports, alternate is coming is few years

collection of existing metal items from common homes to gov offices, except absolute necessary parts like wires, few tools and recycle and store in uniform weight distributed over various safe garded places across world for future use

recycling facility - solar powered small blast furnance
without battery only morning operations 
```

future of transportation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
banning of formula 1, formula-e is there

banning of older vehicles

banning of current public transports = reduce vehicle weight and size

banning of trucks, only air drops for defence equipments

banning of trains, track maintainace creating too pollution because a lot of metal is required.

army vehicles are not efficient

banning of commercial heavy metal shipping vessels, new vessel = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber + wood + electric propultion + (solar+wind) combo powered.
shipment = only technology, not everything grow food at your country
```

schemes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
No need for capital and cities. 5G and satellite internet is already here. disperse the crowd ( new invention required : oneweb to 5G converter technology do not exist)

wheat, rice, pulses can be bought only. rest grow on your own.

gov has no buisness in buisness. convert all gov manufacturing and service to private

reduction of pol muscle and fire and vehicles speed.

banning of paper 

free speech

banning of currency notes immidietly and digital apps are already there.

banning of fiber optic cables.

banning of street lights and pole = solar powered, 20 w LED enough ....should be mounted on a tree rather than steel pole 

reduction of classrooms in schools and colleges rather sports and art clubs, markets, online apps are enough for meeting discovering new people already. But practical labs should remain the same.

pre set adult content filter by google and all

So many things not to do, so what shoud we do = decision making, learn, observe, and art, culture(sports, dance, music, movies) , exploration, tourism thats where you should focus on.

Automatic deletion of data = google, Microsoft, meta ... Free up data centers...1 backup in data center another should be peer to peer distributed 

Be careful that even small things can cause lot of pollution

Metal cement petroleum and transportation

Anything linked to this creates pollution

Because these are obtained through mining.
