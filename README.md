`Planet safe. This info will tune your mind to absolute intellect`
============================================================================================

Methods and material are abundant, and can be launched immediately effectively. 

Don't approach too fast, it may backfire... Slow adaptation.. Not too slow either.

You can't change the world without changing yourself first. and we can change ourselves.

Can't push the change if the alternative is not there, find the alternative first.

Don't make rules that can't be enforced. 

If the executive comes in way, blow the whistle by the judiciary.

What we are trying here is to minimize the use of materials that are mined - metal, cement, minerals. As well as inorganic labs made synthetic like plastic. 

Utensils
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Only unglazed clay and 100 % cast iron(not cast iron alloy, pure no impurities) utensils should be used (some companies are selling steel and writing 100% cast iron, check the factory )(blood is made of iron so no issue)(companies are putting some unknown oil coating to prevent rust)(iron is prone to rust so must be coated with mustard oil only after wash).


100% cast iron wok with lid 3L x 1.

Cast iron pot with lid for boiling.

Flat Pan cast iron.

Cast iron Mortar and pestle (stone, wooden should be avoided due to breakage).


neem Wood Board + rolling pin (avoid stone, plastic, metal). 

Knives big + small (wooden handle is recommended), Cutting board neem wood (avoid stone, plastic or metal). 

Dough mixing pot stainless steel.

Strainer for frying = not the wire mesh one because hard to clean, the one with holes... don't keep it drained because it is stainless steel, not ideal. and cast iron is not possible.

Natural fiber baskets.

Clay storage jars.

Clay glass. 


** non-stick teflon(very dangerous), aluminum, steel, stainless steel, copper, plastic, silicone, tin, ceramic, non stick Teflon utensils should be avoided, but why ? because = metals have leaching properties, can enter the central nervous system, aluminum and copper turn to Al2O3 and CuO. ceramic has paint.


Food Packaging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clay and leaf is recommended.

** Plastic packaging should be avoided(aluminum is slightly better than plastic but still it should be avoided). 
```

Cleaner (utensils/hair/body/cloths/teeth) (won't work if exposed to chemicals, use the normal soap)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Neem wood brush - https://www.amazon.in/Origami-Karma-Tooth-Brush-Bristles/dp/B09MLZ2NDH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2OG0A81Q64JHE&keywords=neem+toothbrush+good&qid=1685100329&sprefix=neem+toothbrush+good%2Caps%2C344&sr=8-5

Teeth cleaning = dried ginger powder, dried amla powder, dried turmeric powder, dried clove powder, raw unrefined sea salt crystals, tulsi.
Mix the above ingredients (no cavity ever)(remember that if you have eaten factory made things like chocolate then this wont work, use toothpaste, it will work but after a few more times). 

Body and cloth(hot water) 
------
Acid wash- lemon/orange/amla juice (squeezing the actual fruit not buying juice bottles from the market). 

Never take a shower bath in hot water, especially head wash, not even in winter. 
If it is too cold then boil the water to 25Â° celsius not above.

Base wash - turmeric/neem in hot boiling water(base wash should be avoided in case of clothes specially white color).

Cast iron utensils
----------
Neutral Salt wash - sea salt in hot boiling water

** Vim, rin, surf, tide, soap, shampoo, hand wash should be avoided (can only be used to clean exposure to chemicals and toxic chemicals like grease, synthetic paint, other chemicals) 
```

Scrubs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Cleaning gloves kitchen+bathroom(ok just this one uses plastic).
Toilet brush x 2(wooden handle).
Scrubbing brush with C type handle x 2(coir)(wooden handle).
Long mop for wet(cloth instead of sponge)(wooden handle).
Broomstick(natural fibers)(wooden handle).

Scthbrite x 4(coir).
Microfiber bundle(reuse old fabric).
Garbage bags(don't use these).
paper towel(don't use these).

Should only be used to remove chemical exposure = Vim, Surf, Harpic, Lysol, acid, Isopropyl alcohol.
```

Grocery(organic is written but to given, so grow your own)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Gmo- genetically modified organisms.

complex carbohydrates = 

Rice (white rice) = dosa/idli/vada/kheer (Avoid basmati rice, it's GMO).
Chudda(poha)(flattened rice) = sweet poha, salty poha.
Muddi(puffed rice) = jhal murri.
khoi(popped rice) = Ukhudda.

** Red, black, brown are GMO should be avoided.

Wheat =  
Atta(brown flour) puri/paratha.
Maida(white flour) = luchi/roll paratha/kachori/nimki/pani puri/noodles/pizza.
Suji(wheat granules) = dosa/idli/vada/upma/kheer.

Plant proteins = 
Unpolished arhar Dal(lentils/ legume) = dal/dalma. 
Unpolished Moong dal = dalma/ saag mung/ dal.
Unpolished Chana dal = dal/dalma/sattu/besan/pampad.
Unpolished Biri/urad dal = dosa/idli/ vada.

** Masoor dal, refined sugar should be avoided.


Achar (pickle) = mango/amla/lemon/chili/ginger.

Jaggery(raw unrefined sugarcane), Misri (crystal raw unrefined sugarcane).


Dry fruits = Almonds, Pistachio, Raisins.

** Avoid walnuts, cashews, peanuts, dates.


Spices = Hing, Mustard seeds, Turmeric whole, Clove whole, Ginger whole, Fennel seeds, Dried mango, Dried amla, Raw sea salt (avoid pink salt from mountain (don't dig the mountain) is limited whereas sea is unlimited and sea is more nutrient dense than mountain).

** Garlic, Garam masala, cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, oregano, star anise, bay leaf, curry leaf, mint leaf, Cummin, methi, kasuri methi should be avoided.


Oil/fat = Cold pressed(not high temperature and pressure pasturisation) mustard oil (banned by godfather(usa), lift the ban)

Dairy(very difficult to get these, should be avoided) but these are very good and very high in protein. 
Ghee (A2 milk not A1, A1 is GMO cow whereas, A2 is unaltered species)(ghee = butter - fat), Butter (A2 milk based)(unsalted), Dahi(greek yogurt) (sour not sweet). 

** Paneer, raw milk should be avoided.
** Non-dairy milk should be avoided like almond milk because it's fake.
** Sunflower, safflower, olive, avocado, rapeseed, palm, vegetable oil should be avoided (expensive slow poisons, increases cholesterol resulting heart attacks, these oils + gym is fatal)


Fruits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orange, Bananas (big ones are GMO), Green Grapes (dark grapes are GMO), Coconut, Mangoes (avoid Alphonso it's GMO), Bael, Amla.

** Apple, strawberry, watermelon, guava, jackfruit, pineapple, lichi, kiwi, raspberry, blueberry etc should be avoided, (Steve jobs died because of this, he didnt know which fruit to eat).


Vegetables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Well, the growth in carbon dioxide over the past 100 years has made plants addicted so, the plants now have high sugar levels and decrease in protein but it will level up after the pollution is gone. Protein is not necessary for every person except (physical labor) and sugar can be drained by doing exercise so there is no issue.

Koshola saag(spinach)(other saags should be avoided), Pumpkin (very big ones are gmo), Potal, Sweet potato, Egg plant(only one in a day not more, and small one not big one, big one is gmo), Raddish, Green bananas, green Chili ( careful don't buy big gmo ones), Lemon (what to say its magical).

** Onion, tomato, corn, okra, carrot, turnip, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, palak, peas, bell pepper, Peas, Beans, Potato (brownies/fries), beans etc should be avoided.
```

Women_specific
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Jewelry = gold, silver, diamond, sea shells, pearls(not compatible for everyone), rudraksha, wood,  feathers)  don't use plastic or other metal jewels.
Avoid gem stones = there is math formula to calculate what is suitable to whom

Makeup = Nail polish (ancient alta was used for nail polish, lipstick and blush) but are not available today in markets but can be homemade. 
Alta available in the market is fake, made of chemical whereas ancient alta was made from raw sugar or paan leaf either, not sure about formula needs more research(million dollar startup idea).

** Coloring hair tip will also soak NH3-ammonia compounds in hair color into skin.
** Henna mehndi is also very bad.
** Kajal, eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, glitters, lipstick, foundation, all types of talc(should be avoided).
** Avoid Vaseline and other petroleum jellies.
** Avoid waxing hair.

Hair oil if you use = Pure coconut oil/amla.

Fragrance = Lotus oil (scent), Sandalwood oil (scent), Rajnigandha oil (scent), Marigold oil (scent), maybe more flowers need more research.

** Perfume, deo (lots of chemicals) should be avoided.
** Do not use incense sticks.(you don't know what is inside).
** Don't use candles.(These are dangerous)

Cloth fabric(Hand woven, hand stitched) = Cotton(everyday), Silk(occasions), Hemp.

Color- light color.
** Dark color clothes should be worn if temperature is below 25 degree celsius and low humidity
** Elastane, spandex, linen, polyester, should be avoided

** Jeans(factory worker)(takes huge water to manufacture) and H&M should be avoided. 
** I mean everyday, We don't like to wear too much clothes, Just minimal clothes... I mean girls won't wear too much clothes anyway... And the weather is hot already.

Ban collar, ties, coats, and replace zips with buttons. (These are part of excess)
Well comfort is the first priority, too much tight and skinny clothes should be avoided.

Kids = Boy girl same dress.. Cotton light color... Shorts and half sleeve shirt and tshirt... Not same uniform and color(people are diffrent and diverse).

Health tips = 

Drink water = 5 liters a day.

To avoid skin diseases one should take bath at least twice a day.

Eye power loss - the inactiveness of the eye lens, so takeoff your glasses then for 5 minutes every day you have to look and focus at the sun while the sun is red, sunrise and sunset, or moon...not when the sun is white or you will get blind... These are the farthest objects. Well watching stars won't help because they are just too far and considered point objects.
And washing eyes and face with cold water at least 5 times a day or eyes will get damaged.

Banning of gym equipments, too much equipments(creating pollution due to excess metal use)(well the few pursuing professionals have to use wooden weights, use brick weights)(unhygienic-lot of people using the same) (weight lifting can cause permanent tissue damage in long run), first Stretching + then Running + yoga + martial arts + relaxation...is enough and very safe.

Ban on cosmetic surgery.

Hygiene = reusable cotton pads (normal is ok for outside purposes but creating pollution) = https://www.amazon.in/Sirona-Reusable-Sanitary-Pads-Women/dp/B09ZDSZQG6/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1UC5YMYVQB50S&keywords=reusable+pads+for+women&qid=1684813278&sprefix=reus%2Caps%2C305&sr=8-6
Protection = non lubricated condoms (example brand = trojan)(lubricated = chemical) = https://www.amazon.in/Trojan-ENZ-Non-Lubricated-Condoms-Count/dp/B0001Q6DEU

Well, more awareness should be provided to girls from a young age about masturbation, many are developing breast, vaginal cancer due sexual dissatisfaction, privacy and separate rooms should be provided by parents.
```

Drinks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Drinks = Lemonade, Fruit juice (Grape, mango, sugarcane, orange), Coconut water.

** All types of supplements(you don't need them=expensive urine), Tea, coffee, health drinks(horlicks), chocolate, redbull(taurine),  cola, soda, lassi, milkshake, aloe vera are dangerous. sugar free is more dangerous than sugar(don't fake your receptors).


Alcohol (decision making ability is affected and leads to poor judgment, enhances the anger) = White wine (green grapes), Rum (sugarcane), Wheat beer.

**Whiskey, vodka, gin, normal beer (barley) , red wine( dark grapes) should be avoided.


Smoke(enhance decision making process, decreases the anger)

Ganja(Marijuana)/bhang(Cannabis)/hash(raisin) (can cure all diseases, it has no side effects or overdose)(brain has cannabinoid receptors by default)(only sativa all other are GMO)

Opium (can cure all diseases but it has overdose so caution is required, that's why the first option is recomended).


Well a disease is an idea, I had a panic attack 4 times well nothing serious. But I made the same mistake 4 times over excitement... The thing is there is a sequence... You can smoke pot first and then drink alcohol and then smoke again if you want. 

But if you drink first and then smoke pot... Then you will get a panic attack, well nothing serious just sleep for 1 hr on the spot... Everything will get normal... Max you will get unconscious.

The reason is THC is stronger than alcohol... That means if you smoke first then alcohol will not have an effect. 

It is like you eat the less sweet first and then the more sweet item, but in this case you should have more sweet(weed) first.


Hemp cigarettes can replace nicotine(hemp has very lower THC than marijuana).

**Never use cigarettes(carcinogenic), cocaine and others(these are synthetic, inorganic, lab made, lots of chemicals).
```

Cooking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Never eat too much at once, eat less but 4 times and if not feeling hungry reduce the previous meal next time.

Cooking time = 15 - 20 minutes MAX, I live at sea level (might need more in few areas like norway or himalayas altitude affects the pressure, population density is low , so no problem).

Procedure
-----------
rice/poha, dal and dishes.
_______________________
Oil(fat) goes first. 
Spices if required.
Veggies or rice or dal.
Close the lid.
Boil it for 15 mins until done, don't open the lid yet.
Fine tuning the technique, after a few rounds you will get the idea.

The world cooks bread well, no need to specify.

Other food items = Mustard paste curries, Mango khatta, Dahi vada.

Rice = plain/salty/sweet/pudding.

Pitha(sanskrit)(greek = pitta/ roman = pizza)(something stiff = bread). 
Rice or suji pitha = dosa/idli/vada.
Wheat pitha =  roti/nan(this one is Italian pizza).
Fried wheat pitha = puri/luchi.

Sweet pitha = cakera(sanskrit) = (cake = sweet pizza) (donut/pretzel comes in this category). 

Dessert = Peda, Ladoo(boondi/coconut), Gulab jamun, almond barfi.

** Cashew barfi, should be avoided
```

Appliances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
LED Bulb - 4 watts (study room) to 9 watts(outside) enough, golden yellow color light, use white color light outside or bathroom but not living room, bed room...white emits UV...can damage eyes = 1 USD max(available all around the world).

BLDC fan - 30 to 40 watts, bldc motor fans = 30 USD max(available all around the world).


Stove - wood fire, cast iron hot plate cooker(heating coil inside) by solar.... not induction cooker(magnetism) = 20 USD max(available all around the world).

Microwave and other ovens - stainless steel and teflon coating inside, very dangerous.

Mixer/ grinder/ juicer = there is a poisonous grease inside the blade bearing so avoid these.

Water purifier - live near river drink direct, well water drink direct(not steady wells/only stream wells), don't dig new wells like every person is boring his own, stop cities live near river....never use RO - its equivalent to distilled water used in big batteries and has nothing in it, no minerals.


1 star = very high consumption, highest bill, lowest efficiency.
2 star, 3 star, 4 star.
5 star = very low consumption, lowest bill, highest efficiency.

Refrigerator(100w) =  200 liters 5 star inverter fridge = 200 USD max.

Ac(500w) = is it really required, 1.5 ton 5 star dual inverter portable ac, if dual inverter is expensive now if not available can by single inverter not much difference  = 600 USD max(available all around the world).

[https://www.amazon.in/dp/B084LGQKD7/?coliid=I2BFB5UG6QLVLQ&colid=1IDYXFOGSKWFV&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it]
Washing machine(300w) = 8 kg, 5 star inverter automatic with hot water feature, don't buy dryer, or inbuilt dryer(use rare) for rainy days ...sun dry is best  = 300 USD max(available all around the world).

Dishwasher(200w) = 5 star inverter = 300 USD max(available all around the world).


On spot power generation is recommended (transmission lines are very inefficient; more than half the power lost is hysteresis only).
--------------------------
solar panel = mono perc [500 w] (life = 25 years) = 300 USD max(available all around the world)(might require 2 panels in low sunlight areas like norway).
solar inverter with wifi phone app = [4 kw] (life = depends) = 200 USD max(available all around the world).
battery = lead battery[300Ah] (not good but for now until hydrogen fuel cell/electrolyzer is available) (life = 10 years if lucky) = 300 USD max(available all around the world).


Internet = starlink(available)(expensive), oneweb(low price)(wait for launch soon)(no separate dish, cable tv or anything required).

Bluetooth speaker = apple home/alexa studio/sony srs-xb43 for music, phone speakers will be enough in the future, the tech already exists but profit is coming in the way, just need four drivers. 

Phone + tab + pc in one device = samsung/microsoft rollable phone (coming soon)(reduction of electronic waste). https://youtu.be/xT9F9eW6mYI

printer = thermal printers(not for everyone, save paper).

Ban watches, smartwatches are there.

Security camera = your own country brands, just infrared vision for night, free cloud storage for a week at least for crime detection, but the data center needs to be secure and in the same country. 

Door lock = design change required by replacing steel with carbon fiber or flax fiber.

Tv = well tv uses a lot of plastic, portable laser Projector are future = anker capsule similar.

Most people should use e bikes or scooters(2 wheelers) = vespa electrica and equivalent.
Best car in the world = cheapest EV available(citroen e-c3) = 15000 USD max (till 2023)(well ev solar charging would require 1 more solar panel addition to above calculation).

The best car is the Toyota Mirai but it is very expensive right now, because its life span is 100 years, it is called a forever car.(future is green hydrogen fuel cell not "Lithium battery = toxic and canât be used in aviation").

** A lot of metals need to be removed from these appliances and replaced by flax fiber.
```


Policy change
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Ban public chairs, seats from cement, plastic, stone and metal. By wood only. Stop building statues... Planet doesn't even like a stone to be picked up.

Banning of street lights and poles = solar powered, 20 w LED enough ....should be mounted on a tree rather than steel pole. 

Fans can be made with flax fiber so why metal and plastic.

Solar parks are not helpful because there is huge transmission loss. [V = IR][R = p x Length/Area](That means if length increases, resistance increases, if resistance increases voltage and current decreases.)
Every other source is very limited except solar, sunlight is unlimited, so it has to be the only source. Solar panels don't require sunny day just morning is enough.

Banning of paper.

Banning of currency notes immediately and digital apps are already there.

The clay artists and over jobs where heat curing is required, the oven power should be solar not wood or coal.


Stop building hydro power dams.

Free phones for poor.

Wheat, rice, pulses can be bought only. rest grow on your own.

Ba synthetic chemical fertilizers.


Banning of fiber optic cables.

No need for capital and cities. 5G and satellite internet is already here. disperse the crowd. ( new invention required : oneweb to cellular 5G converter technology doesn't exist)

The government has no business in business. convert all gov manufacturing and service to private.

Reduction of police muscle and fire and vehicle speed.


Automatic deletion of data = google, Microsoft, meta ... Free up data centers...1 backup in a data center another should be peer to peer distributed. 

Be careful that even small things and negligence can cause a lot of pollution.

Metal cement petroleum and transportation, anything linked to this creates pollution, because these are obtained through mining. 
```

House construction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Satellite imagery land allocation, same for each person.

Every person should get his own room in a family (not a small room, mind needs more room to grow), but smallest bathroom possible. (Room size = length - 5 m, breadth - 5 m, height - 4 m, Bathroom size = length - 3 m, breadth - 1 m, height - 4 m, Kitchen size = length - 5 m, breadth - 2 m, height - 4 m)

Area for gardening. Minimize gardening tools(more wood, less metal, less power tools).


Never build cement houses(especially those who live near earthquake zones).(We can't increase weight of the place)

Wood and mud combined houses are best and you will be so happy.

Build only the house not floors above, it is very important to escape emergency situations like fire.

Four very tall trees at 4 corners of the house to ground the current in case of lightning. 

Ancient structures like Rome and temples of india are made of (lime mortar) . It is a natural eco-friendly cement made from baked dead sea shells hand picked and collected from sea shore. (Today's cement = modern cement = CaCO3 is obtained by mining.)

Bricks = baked is a solar powered curing oven.

Ban marble.

Ban metal pipes. (Only this one plastic) 

Wiring = 1mm gauge wire enough to handle the load, not thicker wires or loss will increase.


Furniture- minimum furniture, minimum wood design(not heavy) and without paint and polish(chemicals).

Home decors are not eco friendly.

Wall paints(emulsion) are synthetic.

Coir mattress only.

Ban pencils, clips, pins, pen, clipboard , duct tape, nails.

Ban paper towels.

Ban the books.

Ban room heaters.

Acrylic paints for artworks, canvas from leaf fiber not cloth.

Children's toys are metal, plastic so ban them.

Ban of fences are important - wire, metal, wall, wood should be avoided... Can plant trees only.
```


Mineral mines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Shutdown all types of power plants. Homes in cities can be powered by solar just 1 panel is required for one home, already available.

Stop digging mines = we don't need metals anymore = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber parts are used now and more efficient and lightweight.

Banning of cement.

Ban glass items.

Collection of existing metal items from common homes to gov offices, except absolute necessary parts like wires, few tools and recycle and store in uniform weight distributed over various safe guarded places across world for future use.

All carbon capturing ideas and what not is a waste of time and money. They are trying to decontaminate by contaminating further. Manufacturing such machines will increase CO2 even more. Why do we need capturing machines if plants are already doing that, we just need to stop producing. 

Recycling facility - solar powered small blast furnace, without battery, only morning operations. 
```

Future of transportation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Stop constructing new roads, bridges, new ports, alternate(evtols) are coming is few years 

Banning of formula 1, formula-e is there

Banning of older vehicles.

Banning of current public transports = reduce vehicle weight and size

Banning of trucks, only air drops for defense equipments

Banning of trains, track maintenance creating too much pollution because a lot of metal is required.(Stop hyperloop projects around the world, yes elon musk is more like a businessman, he doesn't understand science and technology which most people think)

Ban the boats except wood and electric ones.

Army vehicles are not efficient.

Banning of commercial heavy metal shipping vessels, new vessels = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber + wood + electric propulsion + (solar+wind) combo powered.
Shipment = only technology, important goods not everything, grow food in your country.
```

Miscellaneous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Banning the jury system in courts. we have to put one judge to be responsible. 

Digital e-courts except the criminal court.

Ban concerts.

Ban stadiums.

Ban large gatherings.

Ban religion.

Ban Christmas tree, Halloween pumpkin.(This is madness, I mean few leaves enough but not the whole tree)
Makar sun-kranti-mas(sanskrit) = [occasion marks the transition of the sun from constellation Sagittarius (dhanu) to Capricorn (makara)]
kranti = transition(english), mas = month(english).

Halo-eve
Aluo(sanskrit) = light(english). 
Dipa-balee(diwali)(sanskrit) = Prince Rama returned home after victory. Rama = roma(Italy) = romance
Dipa = butter lamp(english), balee(sacrifice)(english)

Free speech.

We may have to abolish the marriage, which doesn't have any significance today= needs more thinking.

Reduction of classrooms in schools and colleges rather than sports and art clubs, markets, online apps are enough for meeting and discovering new people already. But practical labs should remain the same.

Pre-set adult content filter by google and all.

So many things not to do, so what should we do = decision making, learn, observe, art, culture(sports, dance, music, movies) , exploration, tourism that's where you should focus on.

All the jobs like law, software engineering will be taken by AI, so we don't need more engineers and doctors.
