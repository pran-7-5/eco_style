Appliances

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
LED Bulb - 4 watts (study room) to 9 watts(outside) enough, golden yellow color light, use white color light outside or bathroom but not living room, bed room...white emits UV...can damage eyes = 1 USD max(availiable all around the world)


fan - 30 to 40 watts, bldc motor fans = 30 USD max(availiable all around the world)

stove - wood fire, cast iron hot plate cooker(heating coil inside) not induction cooker(magnetism) = 20 USD max(availiable all around the world)

water purifier - live near river drink direct, well water drink direct....never use RO - its equivalent to distilled water used in big batteries and has nothing in it, no minerals

1 star = very high consumption, highest bill, lowest efficincy
2
3
4
5 star = very low consumption, lowest bill, highest efficincy

refridgerator =  200 liters 5 star inverter fridge = 200 USD max

ac = is it really required, 1.5 ton 5 star dual inverter portable ac, if dual inverter is expensive now if not availiable can by single inverter not much difference  = 600 USD max(availiable all around the world)

[https://www.amazon.in/dp/B084LGQKD7/?coliid=I2BFB5UG6QLVLQ&colid=1IDYXFOGSKWFV&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it]
washing machine = 8 kg, 5 star inverter automatic with hot water feature, dont buy dryer, or inbuit dryer(use rare) for rainy days ...sun dry is best  = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)

dishwasher = 5 star inverter = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)


On spot power generation recomended (transmission lines are very inefficient more than half the power is lost is hysterisis only)
--------------------------
solar panel = mono perc 500 w (life = 25 years) = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)(might require 2 panels in low sunlight areas like norway)
solar inverter with wifi phone app = 4 kw (life = depends) = 200 USD max(availiable all around the world)
battery = lead battery (not good but for now until hydrogen fuel cell is availiable) (life = 10 years if lucky) = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)
```

internet = starlink(availiable)(expensive), oneweb(low price)(wait for launch soon)(no separate dish, cable tv or anything required)

bluetooth speaker = apple home/alexa studio/sony srs-xb43

phone + tab + pc in one device ()

best car in the world = cheapest ev availiable(citroen e-c3) = 15000 USD max (till 2023)



House construction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

never build cement house(especially those who live near earthquake zones)

wood and mud combined houses are best and you will be so happy

well ancient stucture like rome and temples of india are made of (lime mortar) it is a natural ecofriendly cement made from baked sea shells picked and collected from sea shore

todays cement = modern cement = the CaCO3 is obtained in mining

every person should get his own room in a family (not a small room, mind needs more room to grow), but smallest bathroom possible


Mineral mines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

shutdown all types of power plants. homes in cities can be power by solar just 1 panel is required for one home. already availiable.

stop diging mines = we dont need metals anymore = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber parts are used now and more efficient and light weight

stop constructing new roads, bridges, new ports, alternate is coming is few years

collection of existing metal items from common homes to gov offices, except absolute necessary parts like wires, few tools and recycle and store in uniform weight distributed over various safe garded places across world for future use

recycling facility - solar powered small blast furnance
without battery only morning operations 

future of transportation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

banning of formula 1, formula-e is there

banning of older vehicles

banning of current public transports = reduce vehicle weight and size

banning of trucks, only air drops for defence equipments

banning of trains, track maintainace creating too pollution because a lot of metal is required.

army vehicles are not efficient

banning of commercial heavy metal shipping vessels, new vessel = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber + wood + electric propultion + (solar+wind) combo powered.
shipment = only technology, not everything grow food at your country

schemes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No need for capital and cities. 5G and satellite internet is already here. disperse the crowd

wheat, rice, pulses can be bought only. rest grow on your own.

satellite land allocatiion, same for each person

gov has no buisness in buisness. convert all gov manufacturing and service to private

reduction of pol muscle and fire and vehicles speed.

banning of paper 

free speech

banning of currency notes immidietly and digital apps are already there.

reduction of classrooms in schools and colleges rather sports and art clubs, markets, online apps are enough for meeting discovering new people already. But practical labs should remain the same.

So many things not to do, so what shoud we do = decision making, learn, observe, and art, culture(sports, dance, music, movies) , exploration, tourism thats where you should focus on.
