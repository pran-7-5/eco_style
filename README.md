`Planet safe. This info will tune your mind to absolute intellect`
============================================================================================

Methods and material are abundant, can be launched immidietly effectively. 

Don't approach too fast, may back fire... Slow adaptation.. Not too slow either.

You can't change the world without changing your self first. and we can change ourselves.

Can't push the change if alternative is not there find the alternative first.

Don't make rules that can't be enforced. 

If executive comes in way blow the whistle by judiciary.

What we are trying here is to minimize the use of materials that are mined - metal, cement, minerals. As well as inorganic lab made synthetic like plastic. 

utensils
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Only unglazed clay and 100 % cast iron(not cast iron alloy, pure no impurities) utensils should be used (some companies are selling steel and writing 100% cast iron, check the factory )(blood is made of iron so no issue)(companies are putting some unknown oil coating to prevent rust)(iron is prone to rust so must be coated with mustard oil only after wash)


100% cast iron wok with lid 3L x 1

cast iron pot with lid for boiling

Flat Pan cast iron

Cast iron Mortal and pestle (stone, wooden should be avoided due to breakage) 


neem Wood Board + rolling pin (avoid stone, plastic, metal) 

Knifes big + small (wooden handle is recommend), Cutting board neem wood (avoid stone, plastic or metal) 

Dough mixing pot stainless steel

strainer for frying = not the wire mesh one because hard to clean, the one with holes... don't keep it drained because it is stainless steel not ideal. and cast iron not possible.

Natural fiber baskets.

Clay storage jars.

Clay glass. 


** non-stick teflon(very dangerous), aluminium, steel, stainless steel, copper, plastic, silicone, tin, ceramic, non stick Teflon utensils should be avoided, but why ? becasuse = metals have leaching properties, can enter central nervous system, aluminium and copper turns to Al2O3 and CuO. ceramic has paint.


Packaging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clay and leaf is recommend

** Plastic packaging should be avoided(aluminum is slightly better than plastic but still it should be avoided) 
```

Cleaner (utensils/hair/body/cloths/teeth) (wont work if exposed to chemicals, use the normal soap)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
neem wood brush - https://www.amazon.in/Origami-Karma-Tooth-Brush-Bristles/dp/B09MLZ2NDH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2OG0A81Q64JHE&keywords=neem+toothbrush+good&qid=1685100329&sprefix=neem+toothbrush+good%2Caps%2C344&sr=8-5

teeth cleaning = dried ginger powder, dried amla powder, dried turmeric powder, dried clove powder, raw unrefined sea salt crystalls, tulsi
mix above ingridients (no cavity ever)(remember than if you have eaten factory made things like chocolate then this wont work, use toothpaste, it will work but after few more times) 

body + cloth(hot water) 
------
Acid wash- lemon/orange/amla juice (squeezing the actual fruit not buying juice bottle from market) 

Never take shower bath in hot water, especially head wash, not even in winter 
If it is too cold weather then boil the water to 25Â° celsius not above

Base wash - turmeric/neem in hot boiling water(base wash should be avoided in case of cloths specially white color)

cast iron utensils
----------
neutral Salt wash - sea salt in hot boiling water

** vim, rin, surf, tide, soap, shampoo, handwash should be avoided (can only be used to clean exposure to chemicals and toxic chemicals like grease, synthetic paint, other chemicals) 
```

grocery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Gmo- genetically modified organisms

complex carbohydrates

Rice (white rice) = dosa/idli/vada/kheer (Avoid basmati rice it's gmo)
Chudda(poha)(flattened rice) = sweet poha, salty poha
Muddi(puffed rice) = jhal murri
khoi(popped rice) = Ukhudda

** red, black, brown are GMO should be avoided

Wheat =  
atta(brown flour) puri/paratha
maida(white flour) = luchi/roll paratha/kachori/nimki/pani puri/noodles/pizza
suji(wheat granules) = dosa/idli/vada/upma/kheer

plant proteins = 
unpolished arhar Dal(lentils/ legume) = dal/dalma 
unpolished Moong dal = dalma/ saag mung/ dal
unpolished Chana dal = dal/dalma/sattu/besan/pampad
unpolished Biri/urad dal = dosa/idli/ vada

** masoor dal, refined sugar should be avoided


Achar (pickle) = mango/amla/lemon/chili/ginger

Jaggery(raw unrefined sugarcane), Misri (crystall raw unrefined sugarcane)


dry fruits = Almonds, Pistachio, Raisins

** Avoid walnut, cashew, peanut, dates


spices = Hing, Mustard seeds, Turmeric whole, Clove whole, Ginger whole, Fennel seeds, Dried mango, Dried amla, Raw sea salt (avoid pink salt from mountain (don't dig the mountain) is limited whereas sea is unlimited and sea is more nutrient dense than mountain) 

** garlic, Garam masala, cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, star anise, bay leaf, curry leaf, mint leaf, Cummin, methi, kasuri methi should be avoided


fat = Mustard oil (banned by godfather(usa), lift the ban)

dairy(very difficult to get these, should be avoided) but these are very good and very high protein. 
Ghee (A2 milk not A1, A1 is GMO cow whereas, A2 is unaltered species)(ghee = butter - fat), Butter (A2 milk based)(unsalted), Dahi(greek yogurt) (sour not sweet) 

** Paneer, raw milk should be avoided
** Sunflower, safflower, olive, avocado, rapeseed, palm, vegetable oil should be avoided (expensive slow poisions)


fruits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orange, Bananas (big ones are gmo), Green Grapes (dark grapes are gmo), Coconut, Mangoes (avoid Alphonso it's gmo), Bael, Amla.

** Apple, strawberry, watermelon, guava, jackfruit, pineapple, lichi, kiwi, raspberry, blueberry etc should be avoided, (steve jobs died because of this, he didnt know which fruit to eat).


vegetables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** well growth in carbon diaoxide over past 100 years has made plants addicted so, the plants now have bit high sugar levels and decrease in protein but it will level up after the pollution is gone. Protein is not necessary for every people except (physical labour) and sugar can be drained by doing excercise so there is no issue.

Koshola saag(spinach)(other saags should be avoided), Pumpkin (very big ones are gmo), Potal, Sweet potato, Egg plant(only one in a day not more, and small one not big one, big one is gmo), Raddish, Green bananas, green Chili ( careful don't buy big gmo ones), Lemon (what to say its magical).

** Onion, tomato, corn, okra, carrot, turnip, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, palak, peas, bell pepper, Peas, Beans, Potato (brownies/fries), beans etc should be avoided.
```

women_specific
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Jewelry = gold, silver, diamond, sea shells, pearl(not compatible for everyone), rudraaksh, wood,  feathers)  don't use plastic or other metal jewels.
avoid gem stones = there is math formula to calculate what is suitable to whom

Makeup = Nail polish (ancient alta was used for nail polish, lipstick and blush) but are not available today in markets but can be homemade. 
 alta available in market is fake, made of chemical whereas ancient alta was made from raw sugar or paan leaf either one, not sure about formula needs more research(million dollar startup idea)

** Coloring hair tip will also soak NH3-ammonia compounds in hair color into skin
** Henna mehndi is also very bad
** Kajal, eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, glitters, lipstick, foundation, all types of talc(should be avoided) 
** avid Vaseline and other petroleum jellys

hair oil if you use = Pure coconut oil/amla

Fragrance = Lotus oil (scent), Sandalwood oil (scent), Rajnigandha oil (scent), Merigold oil (scent), may be more flowers needs more research.

** perfume, deo (lots of chemical) should be avoided

Cloth fabric = Cotton(everyday), Silk(ocassions), Hemp (Hand woven, hand stiched)

Color- light color
** dark color clothes should be worn if temperature is below 25 degree celsius and low humidity
** elastane, spandex, linen, polyester, should be avoided

** Jeans(factory worker)(takes huge water to manufacture) and h&m should be avoided 
** I mean everyday, We don't like to wear too much clothes, Just minimal clothes... I mean girls won't wear too much clothes anyway... And weather is hot already

Ban collar, ties, coats, and replace zips with buttons.
Well comfort is the first priority, too much tight and skinny cloths should be avoided



hygiene= reusable cotton pads (normal is ok for outside purposes but creating pollution) = https://www.amazon.in/Sirona-Reusable-Sanitary-Pads-Women/dp/B09ZDSZQG6/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1UC5YMYVQB50S&keywords=reusable+pads+for+women&qid=1684813278&sprefix=reus%2Caps%2C305&sr=8-6
protection = non lubricated condoms (example brand = trojan)(lubricated = chemical) = https://www.amazon.in/Trojan-ENZ-Non-Lubricated-Condoms-Count/dp/B0001Q6DEU

well more awareness should be provided to girls from young age about masturbation, many are developing breast, vaginal cancer due sexual dissatisfaction, privacy and separate rooms should be provided by parents.
```

Drinks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Drinks = Lemonade, Fruit juice (Grape, mango, sugarcane, orange), Coconut water.

** all type of suppliments(you don't need them=expensive urine), Tea, coffee, health drinks(horlicks), chocolate, redbull(taurine),  cola, soda, lassi, milkshake, aloe vera are dangerous. sugarfree is more dangerous than sugar(dont fake your receptors).


Alcohol (decision making ability is affected and leads to poor judgement, enhance the anger) = White wine (green grapes), Rum (sugarcane), Wheat beer (only available in Germany) 

**Whiskey, vodka, gin, normal beer (barley) , red wine( dark grapes) should be avoided


Smoke(enhance decision making process, decreases the anger) = Ganja/bhang (can cure all diseases, it has no side effects or overdose) (brain has canabidol receptors by default), Opium (can cure all diseases but it has overdose so caution is required)


Well a disease is an idea, I had panic attack 4 times well nothing serious. But I made the same mistake 4 times over excitement... The thing is there is a sequence... U can smoke pot first and then drink alcohol and then smoke again if u want.... 

But if you drink first and then smoke pot... Then you will get a panic attack, well nothing serious just sleep for 1 hr on the spot... Every thing will get normal... Max you will get unconscious

The reason is thc is stronger than alcohol... That means if you smoke first then alcohol will not have effect... 

It is like you eat the less sweet first and then the more sweet item, but in this case you should have more sweet(weed) first.


hemp ciggarette can replace the nicotine(hemp has very low THC than mariju)

**Never use ciggarette(carcinogenic), cocaine (these are synthetic, inorganic, lab made, lots of chemical
```

scrubs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Cleaning gloves kitchen+bathroom(ok just this one use plastic)
Toilet brush x 2(wooden handle)
Scrubbing brush with C type handle x 2(coir)(wooden handle)

Broom stick(natural fibers)(wooden handle)

Scthbrite x 4(coir)
Microfiber bundle(reuse old fabric)
Garbage bags(dont use these)
paper towel(dont use these)

should only be used to remove chemical exposure = Vim, Surf, Harpic, Lysol, acid, Isopropyl alcohol
```

Cooking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
never eat too much at once, eat less but 4 times and if not feeling hungry reduce the previous meal next time ...

cooking time = 15 - 20 minutes MAX, I live at sea level (might need more in few areas like norway or himalayas altitude affects the pressure, population density is low , so no problem)

procedure
-----------
rice/poha and dishes
_______________________
oil(fat) goes first 
spices if required
veges or rice
close lid 
boil it 15 mins until done, dont open the lid yet
fine tuneing the technique, after few rounds you will get the idea

world cooks bread well no need to specify.

other food items = Mustard paste curries, Mango khatta, Dahi vada

rice = plain/salty/sweet/pudding

pitha(sanskrit)(greek = pitta/ roman = pizza)(something stiff = bread) 
rice or suji pitha = dosa/idli/vada
wheat pitha =  roti/nan(this one is italian pizza)
fried wheat pitha = puri/luchi

sweet pitha = cakera(sanskrit) = (cake = sweet pizza) (donut/pretzel comes in this category) 

Dessert = Peda, Ladoo(boondi/coconut), Gulab jamun, almond barfi

** Cashew barfi, should be avoided
```

Appliances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
LED Bulb - 4 watts (study room) to 9 watts(outside) enough, golden yellow color light, use white color light outside or bathroom but not living room, bed room...white emits UV...can damage eyes = 1 USD max(availiable all around the world)

BLDC fan - 30 to 40 watts, bldc motor fans = 30 USD max(availiable all around the world)


stove - wood fire, cast iron hot plate cooker(heating coil inside) by solar.... not induction cooker(magnetism) = 20 USD max(availiable all around the world)

microwave and other ovens - stainless steel and teflon coating inside, very dangerous

mixer/ grinder/ juicer = there is a poisonous grease inside the blade bearing so avoid these 

water purifier - live near river drink direct, well water drink direct(not steady wells/only stream wells)....never use RO - its equivalent to distilled water used in big batteries and has nothing in it, no minerals


1 star = very high consumption, highest bill, lowest efficincy
2
3
4
5 star = very low consumption, lowest bill, highest efficincy

refridgerator(100w) =  200 liters 5 star inverter fridge = 200 USD max

ac(500w) = is it really required, 1.5 ton 5 star dual inverter portable ac, if dual inverter is expensive now if not availiable can by single inverter not much difference  = 600 USD max(availiable all around the world)

[https://www.amazon.in/dp/B084LGQKD7/?coliid=I2BFB5UG6QLVLQ&colid=1IDYXFOGSKWFV&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it]
washing machine(300w) = 8 kg, 5 star inverter automatic with hot water feature, dont buy dryer, or inbuit dryer(use rare) for rainy days ...sun dry is best  = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)

dishwasher(200w) = 5 star inverter = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)


On spot power generation recomended (transmission lines are very inefficient more than half the power is lost is hysterisis only)
--------------------------
solar panel = mono perc [500 w] (life = 25 years) = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)(might require 2 panels in low sunlight areas like norway)
solar inverter with wifi phone app = [4 kw] (life = depends) = 200 USD max(availiable all around the world)
battery = lead battery[300Ah] (not good but for now until hydrogen fuel cell is availiable) (life = 10 years if lucky) = 300 USD max(availiable all around the world)


internet = starlink(availiable)(expensive), oneweb(low price)(wait for launch soon)(no separate dish, cable tv or anything required)

bluetooth speaker = apple home/alexa studio/sony srs-xb43 for music, phone speakers will be enough in the future, the tech already exist but profit coming in the way, just need four drivers. 

phone + tab + pc in one device = samsung/microsoft rollable phone (coming soon)(reduction of electronic waste)

printer = thermal printers(not for every one, save paper)

Ban watches, smartwatches are there.

security camera = your own country brands, just infrared vision for night, free cloud storage for a week atleast for crime detection, but the data center needs to be secure and in the same country 

door lock = design change required by replacing steel with carbon fiber or flax fiber

tv = well tv uses a lot of plastic, portable laser Projector are future = anker capsule similar


most people should use ebicycles or scooters = vespa electrica and equivalent
best car in the world = cheapest ev availiable(citroen e-c3) = 15000 USD max (till 2023)(well ev solar charging would require 1 more solar panel addition to above calculation)

best car is toyota mirai but very expensive write now, coz its life span is 100 years, it is called a forever car.(future is green hydrogen fuel cell not "Lithium battery = toxic and cant be used in aviation")

** a lot of metals need to be removed from these appliance and replaced by flax fiber.
```


policy change
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Ban public chairs, seats from cement, plastic, stone and metal. By wood only. Stop building statues... Planet doesn't even like a stone to be picked up.

banning of street lights and pole = solar powered, 20 w LED enough ....should be mounted on a tree rather than steel pole. 

Fans can be made with flax fiber why metal and plastic.


banning of paper.

banning of currency notes immidietly and digital apps are already there.

The clay artists and over jobs where heat curing is required, the oven power should be solar not wood or coal.


Stop building dams.

wheat, rice, pulses can be bought only. rest grow on your own.


banning of fiber optic cables.

No need for capital and cities. 5G and satellite internet is already here. disperse the crowd. ( new invention required : oneweb to 5G converter technology do not exist)

gov has no buisness in buisness. convert all gov manufacturing and service to private.

reduction of polic muscle and fire and vehicles speed.

free speech.

We may have to abolish the marriage, doesn't have any significance today= needs more thinking.

reduction of classrooms in schools and colleges rather sports and art clubs, markets, online apps are enough for meeting discovering new people already. But practical labs should remain the same.

pre set adult content filter by google and all.

So many things not to do, so what shoud we do = decision making, learn, observe, and art, culture(sports, dance, music, movies) , exploration, tourism thats where you should focus on.

Automatic deletion of data = google, Microsoft, meta ... Free up data centers...1 backup in data center another should be peer to peer distributed. 

Be careful that even small things and negligence can cause lot of pollution.

Metal cement petroleum and transportation,
anything linked to this creates pollution,
Because these are obtained through mining. 
```

House construction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
satellite land allocatiion, same for each person.

every person should get his own room in a family (not a small room, mind needs more room to grow), but smallest bathroom possible.


never build cement house(especially those who live near earthquake zones).

wood and mud combined houses are best and you will be so happy.

well ancient stucture like rome and temples of india are made of (lime mortar) it is a natural ecofriendly cement made from baked sea shells picked and collected from sea shore.

bricks = baked is solar powered curing oven.

todays cement = modern cement = the CaCO3 is obtained by mining.


Furniture- minimum furniture, minimum wood design(not heavy) and without paint and polish(chemicals).

Home decors, are not eco friendly.

Wall paints(emulsion) are synthetic.

coir mattress only.

Ban pencils, clips, pins, pen, clipboard , duct tape

Ban paper towels.

Ban the books.

Acrylic paints for artworks, canvas from leaf fiber not cloth.

Children toys are metal, plastic ban it.

Ban on Fences are important- wire, metal, wall, wood should be avoided... Can plant trees only.
```


Mineral mines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

shutdown all types of power plants. homes in cities can be power by solar just 1 panel is required for one home. already availiable.

stop diging mines = we dont need metals anymore = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber parts are used now and more efficient and light weight.

Ban glass items.

collection of existing metal items from common homes to gov offices, except absolute necessary parts like wires, few tools and recycle and store in uniform weight distributed over various safe garded places across world for future use.

recycling facility - solar powered small blast furnance, without battery only morning operations. 
```

future of transportation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
stop constructing new roads, bridges, new ports, alternate(evtols) are coming is few years 

banning of formula 1, formula-e is there

banning of older vehicles.

banning of current public transports = reduce vehicle weight and size

banning of trucks, only air drops for defence equipments

banning of trains, track maintainace creating too pollution because a lot of metal is required.

Ban the boats except wood and electric ones.

army vehicles are not efficient.

banning of commercial heavy metal shipping vessels, new vessel = natural flax fiber and carbon fiber + wood + electric propultion + (solar+wind) combo powered.
shipment = only technology, not everything grow food at your country.
