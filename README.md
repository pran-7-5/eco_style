`Planet safe. These lines will tune your mind to absolute intellect`
============================================================================================
It is very difficult to understand that you are a hypocrite. It is very easy to contradict yourself, going round and round. If you won't travel in a straight line in a jungle you will get lost and die.

If you don't observe the details and follow these steps very carefully, you will not get the results that you want to achieve.

Methods and materials are abundant and can be launched immediately and effectively. 

Don't approach too fast, it may backfire, slow adaptation, not too slow either.

You can't change the world without changing yourself first. and we can change ourselves.

Can't push the change if the alternative is not there, find the alternative first.

Don't make rules that can't be enforced. 

If the executive comes in the way, blow the whistle, through the judiciary.

What we are trying here is to minimize the use of materials that are mined - metal, cement, minerals. As well as inorganic labs made synthetic like plastic. 

Utensils
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Only unglazed clay and 100 % cast iron(not cast iron alloy, pure no impurities) utensils should be used (blood is made of iron so no issue)
:warning: some companies are selling steel and writing 100% cast iron, check the factory. (companies are putting some unknown oil coating to prevent rust)(iron is prone to rust so must be coated with mustard oil only after washing).

Cooking pots
________________________________________________ 
100% cast iron wok with lid 3L x 1.

Cast iron pot with lid for boiling.

Flat Pan cast iron.

Accessories
________________________________________________ 
Cast iron Mortar and pestle (stone, wooden should be avoided due to breakage).

Neem Wood Board + rolling pin (avoid stone, plastic, metal). (Neem = antibacterial wood)

Knives big + small (wooden handle is recommended), Cutting board (Neem wood) (avoid stone, plastic or metal). 

Dough mixing pot stainless steel.

Strainer for frying = not the wire mesh one because it is hard to clean, the one with holes, don't keep it drained because it is stainless steel, not ideal. and cast iron is not possible.

Natural fiber baskets.
Clay storage jars.
Clay glass. 

** non-stick teflon(very dangerous), aluminum, steel, stainless steel, copper, plastic, silicone, tin, ceramic, non-stick Teflon utensils should be avoided. 
But why ? because = metals have leaching properties, can enter the central nervous system, aluminum and copper turn to Al2O3 and CuO. ceramic has paint.


Food Packaging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clay and leaf is recommended.

** Plastic packaging should be avoided(aluminum is slightly better than plastic but still it should be avoided). 
```

Cleaner (utensils/hair/body/cloths/teeth) (won't work if exposed to chemicals, use the normal soap)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Neem wood brush - https://www.amazon.in/Origami-Karma-Tooth-Brush-Bristles/dp/B09MLZ2NDH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2OG0A81Q64JHE&keywords=neem+toothbrush+good&qid=1685100329&sprefix=neem+toothbrush+good%2Caps%2C344&sr=8-5

Teeth cleaning = dried ginger powder, dried amla powder, dried turmeric powder, dried clove powder, raw unrefined sea salt crystals, tulsi.
Mix the above ingredients (no cavity ever)(remember that if you have eaten factory made things like chocolate then this wont work, use toothpaste, it will work but after a few more times). 

Body(cold water) and cloth(hot water) 
________________________________________________ 
Acid wash- lemon/orange/amla juice (squeezing the actual fruit not buying juice bottles from the market). 

Never take a shower bath in hot water, especially head wash, not even in winter. 
If it is too cold then boil the water to 25° celsius not above.

Base wash - turmeric/neem in hot boiling water(base wash should be avoided in case of clothes specially white color).

Cast iron utensils
________________________________________________ 
Neutral Salt wash - sea salt in hot boiling water

** Vim, rin, surf, tide, soap, shampoo, hand wash should be avoided. (can only be used to clean exposure to chemicals and toxic chemicals like grease, synthetic paint, other chemicals) 

Pest control
________________________________________________
You have to feed them first at least twice a day, or they will take on their own.  
```

Scrubs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Cleaning gloves kitchen+bathroom(ok just this one uses plastic).
Toilet brush x 2(wooden handle).
Scrubbing brush with C type handle x 2(coir)(wooden handle).
Long mop for wet(cloth instead of sponge)(wooden handle).
Broomstick(natural fibers)(wooden handle).

Scthbrite x 4(coir).
Microfiber bundle(reuse old fabric).
Garbage bags(don't use these).
paper towel(don't use these).

Should only be used to remove chemical exposure = Vim, Surf, Harpic, Lysol, acid, Isopropyl alcohol.
```

Grocery(organic is written but not given, so grow your own)

** Red, black, brown rice are GMO and should be avoided.

Wheat
________________________________________________ 
Atta(brown flour) = puri/paratha.
Maida(white flour) = luchi/roll paratha/kachori/nimki/pani puri/noodles/pizza.
Suji(wheat granules) = dosa/idli/vada/upma/kheer.

Plant proteins
________________________________________________ 
Unpolished arhar Dal(lentils/ legume) = dal/dalma. 
Unpolished Moong dal = dalma/ saag moong/ dal.

** Refined sugar should be avoided.

Dry fruits
________________________________________________ 
Almonds, Pistachio, Raisins.

** Avoid walnuts, cashews, peanuts, dates.

Achar (pickle) = mango/amla/lemon/chili/ginger.

Spices
________________________________________________ 
Hing
Mustard seeds
Turmeric whole
Clove whole
Ginger whole
Fennel seeds
Dried mango
Dried amla
Raw sea salt(avoid pink salt from mountain (don't dig the mountain) is limited whereas sea is unlimited and sea is more nutrient dense than mountain)

** Garlic, Garam masala, cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, oregano, star anise, bay leaf, curry leaf, mint leaf, Cummin, methi, Kasuri methi should be avoided.


Oil/fat
________________________________________________ 
Cold pressed(not high temperature and pressure pasteurization) mustard oil. (banned by godfather(usa), lift the ban)

Dairy(very difficult to get these, should be avoided) but these are very good and very high in protein. 
________________________________________________ 
Ghee (A2 milk not A1, A1 is GMO cow whereas, A2 is unaltered species)(ghee = butter - fat)
Butter (A2 milk based)(unsalted)
Dahi(greek yogurt)(sour not sweet)

** Paneer, raw milk should be avoided.
** Non-dairy milk should be avoided like almond milk because it's fake.
** Sunflower, safflower, olive, avocado, rapeseed, palm, vegetable oil should be avoided (expensive slow poisons, increases cholesterol resulting heart attacks, these oils + gym is fatal)

________________________________________________ 
Vegetables
________________________________________________ 
Koshola saag(spinach)(other saags should be avoided)

Bael
Amla

** Apple, strawberry, watermelon, guava, jackfruit, pineapple, lichi, kiwi, raspberry, blueberry etc should be avoided, (Steve jobs died because of this, he didnt know which fruit to eat).

*** Well, the growth in carbon dioxide over the past 100 years has made plants addicted so, the plants now have high sugar levels and decrease in protein but it will level up after the pollution is gone. 
Protein is not necessary for every person except (physical labor) and sugar can be drained by doing exercise so there is no issue.
```

Women_specific
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Jewelry = gold, silver, diamond, sea shells, pearls(not compatible for everyone), rudraksha, wood,  feathers, don't use plastic or other metal jewels. (Should be stored in an automated bank locker nearest to the house, taken out on occasions.)
Avoid gem stones = there is math formula to calculate what is suitable to whom

Makeup = Nail polish (ancient alta was used for nail polish, lipstick and blush) but are not available today in markets but can be homemade. 
Alta available in the market is fake, made of chemical whereas ancient alta was made from raw sugar or paan leaf, not sure what the formula is, needs more research(million dollar startup idea).

** Coloring hair tips will also soak NH3-ammonia compounds in hair color into skin.
** Henna mehndi is also very bad.
** Kajal, eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, glitters, lipstick, foundation, all types of talc(should be avoided).
** Avoid Vaseline and other petroleum jellies.
** Avoid waxing hair.
** Avoid tattoos, these inks are dangerous. Laser removal looks easy and clean, but it is not actually removing, it's going to dissolve the ink into the blood. The best way is surgical removal, but it is going to leave scars. Well, you could have Google check about the ink before doing so, therefore accept the consequence and move on. 
** Avoid pedicure, manicures at salons.

Hair oil/body lotion if you use = Pure coconut oil/amla.
** Hair dryer, straightening iron should be avoided.

Fragrance = Lotus oil (scent), Sandalwood oil (scent), Rajnigandha oil (scent), Marigold oil (scent), maybe more flowers need more research.

** Perfume, deo (lots of chemicals) should be avoided.
** Do not use incense sticks.(you don't know what is inside).
** Don't use candles.(These are dangerous)
** Don't use mosquito repellent, these chemicals are poisonous. Install nets in the inner window instead of glass. Ok, just this one uses plastic nets. Of course you have to kill the mosquitos 1 by 1.

Cloth fabric(Hand woven, hand stitched) = Cotton(everyday), Silk(occasions), Hemp.
Color- light color. (Things look black because of Black body radiation, which means the object absorbs all the light that is falling on it making it hot, where as white color objects reflects most of the light falling on it hence reducing the temperature)(yes, I am very sad for all my muslim sisters to go through torture)

** Dark color clothes should be worn if temperature is below 25 degree celsius and low humidity
** Elastane, spandex, linen, polyester, should be avoided

** Jeans(factory worker)(takes huge water to manufacture) and H&M should be avoided. 
** I mean everyday, We don't like to wear too much clothes, Just minimal clothes... I mean girls won't wear too much clothes anyway. And the weather is hot already.

Ban collar, ties, coats, and replace zips with buttons. (These are part of excess)
Well comfort is the first priority, too much tight and skinny clothes should be avoided.

Footwear = Sandals/Flip flops instead of shoes.(Air circulation)(Socks, stockings should be avoided)

Kids = Boy/girl same dress(They must understand they are equal from childhood), Cotton light color, shorts and a half sleeve shirt and t-shirt, not the same uniform and color for everyone(people are different and diverse).

tips
________________________________________________ 
Ban on cosmetic surgery.

Hygiene = reusable cotton pads (normal is ok for outside purposes but creating pollution) = https://www.amazon.in/Sirona-Reusable-Sanitary-Pads-Women/dp/B09ZDSZQG6/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1UC5YMYVQB50S&keywords=reusable+pads+for+women&qid=1684813278&sprefix=reus%2Caps%2C305&sr=8-6
Protection = non lubricated condoms (example brand = trojan)(lubricated = chemical) = https://www.amazon.in/Trojan-ENZ-Non-Lubricated-Condoms-Count/dp/B0001Q6DEU

Well, more awareness should be provided to girls from a young age about masturbation, many are developing breast, vaginal cancer due sexual dissatisfaction, privacy and separate rooms should be provided by parents.
```

Health tips
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Banning of gym equipments, too much equipments(creating pollution due to excess metal use)(well only the few pursuing sports professionals have to use wooden weights, use brick weights)(unhygienic-lot of people using the same) 
(weight lifting can cause permanent tissue damage in the long run), yoga is enough and very safe.

Cold/fever/headache/backpain = It happens because you have taken too much workload. So take rest, drink water, eat more fruits, no need to take tablets or medication. (You will get better in a week maximum)
(Caution. do not take medicine and tablets that you see in tv ads like disprin, crocin these are fatal drugs in some cases)(Go to doctor if problem continues)

Stomach ache/ acidity =  It happens because you have taken too much work load or food poisoning (you have eaten something that you didn't want to eat but ate anyway), or bad habits like not sleeping early or late night mischief. So take a rest, drink water, eat more fruits. 
You may need to take a tablet = esomeprazole magnesium 40(you can buy this without prescription, it acts very fast like within 5 minutes, eat something after taking the tablet). (You will get better in a week maximum)(Don't take this tablet regularly or you might develop stones)
```

Drinks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Drinks = Lemonade, Fruit juice (Grape, mango, sugarcane, orange), Coconut water.

** All types of supplements(you don't need them = expensive urine), Tea, coffee, health drinks(boost/horlicks), chocolate, redbull(taurine),  cola, soda, lassi, milkshake, aloe vera are dangerous. sugar free is more dangerous than sugar(don't fake your receptors).


Alcohol (decision making ability is affected and leads to poor judgment, enhances the anger) 
________________________________________________
White wine (green grapes)
Rum (sugarcane)
Wheat beer

**Whiskey, vodka, gin, normal beer (barley) , red wine( dark grapes) should be avoided.


Smoke(enhance decision making process, decreases the anger)
________________________________________________
Ganja(Marijuana)/bhang(Cannabis)/hash(raisin) (can cure all diseases, it has no side effects or overdose)(brain has cannabinoid receptors by default)(only sativa species all other are GMO)

Opium (can cure all diseases, but it has overdose so caution is required, that's why the first option is recommended).

Well a disease is an idea, I had a panic attack 4 times well nothing serious. But I made the same mistake 4 times over excitement. The thing is there is a sequence, you can smoke pot first and then drink alcohol and then smoke again if you want. 
But if you drink first and then smoke pot, then you will get a panic attack, well nothing serious just sleep for 1 hr on the spot, everything will get normal, max you will get unconscious.
The reason is THC is stronger than alcohol... That means if you smoke first then alcohol will not have an effect. 
It is like you eat the less sweet first and then the more sweet item, but in this case you should have more sweet(weed) first.

Hemp cigarettes can replace nicotine(hemp has very lower THC than marijuana).(Billion dollar startup idea)

**Never use cigarettes(carcinogenic), e-cigarettes, cocaine and other(these are synthetic, inorganic, lab made, lots of chemicals, fatal).
```

Cooking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Never eat too much at once, eat less but 4 times and if not feeling hungry reduce the previous meal next time.

Cooking time = 15 - 20 minutes MAX, I live at sea level (might need more in few areas like norway or himalayas altitude affects the pressure, population density is low , so no problem).

Procedure
________________________________________________ 
rice/poha, dal and dishes.
________________________________________________ 
Oil(fat) goes first. 
Spices if required.
Veggies or rice or dal.
Add required Water.
Close the lid.
Boil it for 15 mins until done, don't open the lid yet.
Fine tuning the technique, after a few rounds you will get the idea.

Fried wheat Pitha(sanskrit) = puri(fried)/luchi(fried).

Sweet Pitha = cakera(sanskrit) = (cake = sweet pizza) (donut/pretzel comes in this category). 

Dessert = Peda, Ladoo(boondi/coconut), Gulab jamun, almond barfi.

** Cashew barfi, should be avoided

New born baby
________________________________________________ 
Initially breastfeeding as long as the woman can produce milk.

Just boiled and smashed rice/chuda(poha/flattened rice)(these are carbohydrates very necessary, it is the building block), extra boiled very soft like pudding, but without salt and spices and oil.

Then if the baby has gained some weight then dal(It is protein so check if the baby is ready, and not showing any problem), but still avoid oil and spices.
Then khichdi is a good dish for babies. It is rice and dal mixed and boiled together without salt, oil and spices. 

** Avoid factory made products like lactogen and what not, avoid cow or any other milk, salt, sweet, oil and spice that comes after 5 years of age. 
```

(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)

The best car is the Toyota Mirai but it is very expensive right now, because its life span is 100 years, it is called a forever car.(future is green hydrogen fuel cell not "Lithium battery = toxic and can’t be used in aviation").

** A lot of metal parts need to be removed from these appliances and replaced by hemp fiber.
```


Policy change
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Infrastructure
________________________________________________ 
Ban public chairs, seats from cement, plastic, stone and metal. By wood only. Stop building statues. Planet doesn't even like a stone to be picked up.

Banning of street lights and poles = solar powered, 20 w LED enough, should be mounted on a tree rather than steel pole. 

Equipments
________________________________________________ 
Banning of paper.

Banning of currency notes immediately and digital apps are already there.

The clay artists and over jobs where heat curing is required, the oven power should be solar not wood or coal.

Free phones for the poor.

Banning of fiber optic cables.

No need for capital and cities. 5G and satellite internet is already here. Disperse the crowd. ( new invention required : Oneweb to cellular 5G converter technology doesn't exist)

Food
________________________________________________ 
Wheat, rice, pulses can be bought only. rest grow on your own.

Ban synthetic chemical fertilizers.

Administration
________________________________________________ 
The government has no business in business. convert all gov manufacturing and service to private.

Reduction of police muscle and fire and vehicle speed. 

Free speech. Right to information.

We may have to abolish the marriage, which doesn't have any significance today = needs more thinking.

Abolition of schools and colleges (sports and art clubs, markets, online apps are enough for meeting and discovering new people already) 


Be careful that even small things and negligence can cause a lot of pollution.

Metal cement petroleum and transportation, anything linked to this creates pollution, because these are obtained through mining. 
```

House construction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Land allocation
________________________________________________ 
Satellite imagery land allocation, same for each person.

Every person should get his own room in a family (not a small room, mind needs more room to grow), but smallest bathroom possible. 
(Room size = length - 5 m, breadth - 5 m, height - 4 m, Bathroom size = length - 3 m, breadth - 1 m, height - 4 m, Kitchen size = length - 5 m, breadth - 2 m, height - 4 m)

Area for gardening. Minimize gardening tools(more wood, less metal, less power tools).

Exterior
________________________________________________ 
Never build cement houses(especially those who live near earthquake zones).(We can't increase weight of the place)

Wood and mud combined houses are best and you will be so happy.

Build only the house not floors above, it is very important to escape emergency situations like fire.

Four very tall trees at 4 corners of the house to ground the current in case of lightning. 

Four windows on four walls of the room for natural ventilation and cooling in summer hot weather.

East facing main entrance. (To honor and remember that we are made from the Sun and its light should enter first at sunrise, like the colosseum, parthenon, pyramid of giza, chichen itza.

Ancient structures like Rome and temples of India are made of (lime mortar) . It is a natural eco-friendly cement made from baked dead sea shells hand picked and collected from sea shore. (Today's cement = modern cement = CaCO3 is obtained by mining.)

Bricks = baked is a solar powered curing oven.

Ban marble.

Ban metal pipes. (Only this one plastic) 


Electrical wiring
________________________________________________ 
Wiring = 1mm gauge insulated copper wire enough to handle the load, not thicker wires or loss will increase.

Earth wiring = 6ft deep grounding, 3-4 mm gauge uninsulated  copper wire.

The wiring should be done in such a way that the least and shortest length of wire is used to connect every room from the MCB. Don’t create points on every wall, just one wall is enough. 
MCB - Main circuit breaker

Interior
________________________________________________ 
Furniture- minimum furniture, minimum wood design(not heavy) and without paint and polish(chemicals).
Coir mattress only.

Metal screws and nails should be avoided.

Home decors are not eco friendly.
Wall paints(emulsion) are synthetic.

Ban pencils, clips, pins, pen, clipboard , duct tape .
Ban paper towels.
Ban the books.

Ban room heaters.

Acrylic paints for artworks, canvas from leaf fiber not cloth.
Children's toys are metal, plastic so ban them.
Flower pots = Clay only. (Avoid Plastic, cement, metal, ceramic)

Ban of fences are important - wire, metal, wall, wood should be avoided... Can plant trees only.
```

Mineral mines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Shutdown all types of power plants. Homes in cities can be powered by solar. Just 1 panel is required for one home, already available.

Solar parks are not helpful because there is huge transmission loss. [V = IR][R = p x Length/Area](That means if length increases, resistance increases, if resistance increases voltage and current decreases.)
Every other source is very limited except solar, sunlight is unlimited, so it has to be the only source. Solar panels don't require a sunny day, just morning is enough.

Stop building wind mills.(huge metal use)(huge transmission loss)(natural flow is disrupted)(reaction force(force required to keep it in its place) is very high)

Stop building tidal mills.(huge metal use)(huge transmission loss)(natural flow is disrupted)(reaction force(force required to keep it in its place) is very high)

Stop building hydro power dams.(huge metal use)(huge transmission loss)(natural flow is disrupted)(reaction force(force required to keep it in its place) is very high)

Control of lithium mines. It can't be stopped until hydrogen fuel cells are available.

Stop digging mines = we don't need metals anymore = natural hemp fiber and carbon fiber parts are used now and more efficient and lightweight.

Banning of cement.

Ban glass items.

Collection of existing metal items from common homes to gov offices, except absolute necessary parts like wires, few tools and recycle and store in uniform weight distributed over various safe guarded places across world for future use.

All carbon capturing ideas and what not is a waste of time and money. They are trying to decontaminate by contaminating further. Manufacturing such machines will increase CO2 even more. Why do we need capturing machines if plants are already doing that, we just need to stop producing. 

Recycling facility - solar powered small blast furnace, without battery, only morning operations. 
```

Future of transportation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Stop constructing new roads, bridges, new ports, alternate(EVTOLS) are coming is few years 

Banning of formula 1, motogp. (formula-e is there)

Banning of older vehicles.

Banning of current public transports = reduce vehicle weight and size

Banning of trucks, only air drops for defense equipments

Banning of trains, track maintenance creating too much pollution because a lot of metal is required.(Stop hyperloop projects around the world, yes elon musk is more like a businessman, he doesn't understand science and technology which most people think)

Banning of trams.

Ban the boats except wood and electric ones.

Army vehicles are not efficient.

Banning of commercial heavy metal shipping vessels, new vessels = natural hemp fiber and carbon fiber + wood + electric propulsion + (solar+wind) combo powered.
Shipment = only technology, important goods not everything, grow food in your country.

Hydrogen generation = Solar panel + Electrolyzer

Space
________________________________________________ 
Hydrogen rockets.

International
________________________________________________ 
Hydrogen aircrafts.

Intercity
________________________________________________ 
EVTOL Air taxi = hire,  ambulance.

Intracity(But you have said no road, OK wait, elevated surface automatic mud road leveling machine(roller), we just need to level the mud road time to time, like day after the rain)
________________________________________________ 
Moped. (Two wheeler)

Car hire - 100 Km/h max speed (Autopilot car)

Public transport - 80 Km/h max speed (Autopilot mini bus)(tank like wheel bus)(Men/women separate section right side/ left side) 

Heavy transport - only helicopter (Rare use)

Near by
________________________________________________ 
Bicycle, e-scooter.
```

Softwares
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Automatic deletion of data = google, Microsoft, meta ... Free up data centers...1 backup in a data center another should be peer to peer distributed.

Product verification before dispatch. (Hide seller id and consumer id if manually checked for certain products) 

Amazon go (automatic shops)(But man women different sections are required) - food items should not be sold online. (Most people are not buying anyway)

Robot - cleaning, washing, cooking.

Pre-set adult content filter by google and all.

Both hardware and software are closed source, not allowing us to see if there is any subroutine that can automatically search the content. (Apple, microsoft, google, meta)
But Android is open source so we can see what's inside... And it's very good, but the other problem is that it is forcing us to use google's other services that are closed source. They are not letting us see inside the source code. 
For example Linux is open source and used by all servers. This is very good.

Closed source (spying)  | Open source (Very safe)     
------------------------|----------------------------
Whatsapp                | Signal     
     
So tell them to open source fast or shutdown we don't need these.(Apple, microsoft, google, meta)           
        

Grievance redressal mechanism (This software is very easy to make, can be made within a day. Give the contract to Google.)
________________________________________________ 
Create an issue. (automatic routing to respective department) 

Solve issues. (within 24 hrs) 

If recreated. (if unsatisfactory) 

Inform top level. (auto upgrade) 

If not solved within 24 hrs. (auto deduction of salary from department head to victim) 

Court reforms
________________________________________________ 
Banning the jury system in courts. we have to put one judge to be responsible. Digital e-courts except the criminal court.
Legal battle needs to be free and smooth, self representation. Simplification of case file(only digital) 

Digital election
________________________________________________ 
Voting from registered phone number.

Citizen Id
________________________________________________ 
I mean what nonsense, biometric id, voter id, tax id, passport id, driving id, health id but still no facility. (Keep one number only)
```

Media
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Best picture and sound quality = BBC, Warner bros, Nolan, Tom cruise, Marvel studios.

News
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't read papers. (Too slow)
I don't read magazines. (Too slow)

Best news in India = palki sharma 
Best news in west(america + europe) = kay burley 
Best news in Israel = i24NEWS English
Best news in Russia = RT
Best news in France = France24 - François Picard (good, but too much pro govt.)

Deutsche Welle = too slow, too much pro govt.
China = 
Al Jazeera = arabic channel without a single arab (this is propaganda)

Limitations = 

Too much content about stupid politicians, 5% about reforms.
Too many posts overall.
Not brief, not precise.

Technology limitations = Not using right tools.

Camera = Sony alpha 1($5000) (This is a mirrorless camera with autofocus 8K res, it is a low light technology, does not require light)
Gimbal = Freefly Movi Pro($3,995)

Microphone = Sony DWX Digital Wireless

Conference = Sony PCS-XG100
Background Screens = Sony ZRD-2 Video Wall
Tv = Sony bravia 4K/8K

Graphics = Lacks vector graphics, Lacks organic theme too much factory made
Logo = Lack of vector graphics, Not organic looking, only 2 colors should be used and small letters, off color like off white, off blue.

Studio = Not classic, not organic looking, no wooden furniture, too much white light like an operation theater.
```

Miscellaneous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Ban concerts. Ban stadiums. Ban large gatherings.

Ban religion.
Ban on coffins.

How to process a dead body = remove the required organs and donate to organ banks, those who want to bury without the coffin and the cement block they used to build on it,  let them do that, they have free will. (or the enemies will pee on it after getting drunk)
But the best way is to put the bodies in a solar powered shredder and mix it with desert sand to manufacture organic manure for agriculture. (No, I am not cruel yet)

Ban Christmas tree, Halloween pumpkin.(This is madness, I mean few leaves enough but not the whole tree)(This is pre christian tradition)
Makar sun-kranti-mas(sanskrit) = [occasion marks the transition of the sun from constellation Sagittarius (Dhanu) to Capricorn (Makara)]
Kranti = transition(english), mas = month(english).

Halo-eve(This is pre christian tradition)
Aluo(sanskrit) = Lamp/light(english). 
Dipa-balee(diwali)(sanskrit) = Prince Rama returned home after victory, rescuing his kidnapped wife. Rama = roma(Italy) = romance
Dipa = butter lamp(english), balee(sanskrit) = sacrifice(english)
Aluo(sanskrit)-balee(sanskrit) = Lamp/light(english)-sacrifice(english)

So many things not to do, so what should we do = decision making, learn, observe, art, culture(sports, dance, music, movies) , exploration, tourism that's where you should focus on.

All jobs like law, software engineering will be taken by AI, so we don't need more engineers and doctors.

Well I have seen around 500 movies. These are the best of the best. I am sad I lost my backup hard disk drive last October I think. I know I am a software engineer but what can I say about my negligence. 
Remember that you have to transfer your backup before 6 years to a new drive. The lifespan of a hard disk is 6-7 years MAX. 
Now the latest technology is NVME drives.

About the cosmos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
People often ask me why all this? 

And I say your question is wrong, Why not. You are asking me only because you are here. 
Then, they ask, what is the start and what is the end. 

I say there is no start and there is no end. 
Sanskrit = An-ant
English = No-end

Then they say I can't understand where the boundary is ?
And I reply
Sanskrit = a-chint-ya
English = un-think-able
It is difficult to think and hard to grasp. 

Then they say we can't touch the star? 
I say do you want to get burnt. You are standing on one and you are the remains. 

You have heard of a book called A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. Well it is a waste of time. 
Yes there was no big bang, some nut bags sitting in an air conditioned room at Trinity hall thinks so, well they all are dead now with their nobel prizes. 

Well stars are born like that with a lot of noise like a crying newborn baby pulled out of the womb. 
But the cosmos is something else, has no beginning and no end. There is no big bang and there will be no big crunch. 
```

Religion (I don't think there is such a thing, everyone is same)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
There is nothing called God. What do you mean by god, no one can explain. 

Rome doesn't have a record of such a person. 

Who is more wise a person living in jungles, rivers, mountains or a desert dweller. 
Even that, is the person's role significant enough to be remembered.

The oil is drying up and there won't be enough money to power up Air conditioners in burj khalifa. 
I think they will install rocket engines and launch it to the moon, at least the journey to heaven will give some relief. 

Why did you grow the population if you don't have enough resources, you don't have agricultural land. Well try drinking the oil no one will buy it anyway. 
This is an example of extreme ignorance. They will keep killing each other. 
```

Devas, deus( ), theos()  (Again these are not called gods, people use word god because western people don’t know any other word)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Devas - tools - a person having ideal qualities- ideal senses 

There can be a lot of devas. 
But the fundamental is 3 devas, the Trinity. 

So all the qualities that you can have are there in any of these 3 devas. 
```

Purpose of life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
These below lines are absolute, so don't worry it is very difficult to achieve this. 

Animals(hardware) evolved to become more complex animals until it became manu that's where the evolution stopped. 
The animal which is the best hunter is the lion. The animal which is the best flier is the eagle. Like that the animal which is the best thinker is man. 


Manu(manas) = man(mind), once you are a mind kind of animal then the physical evolution(interspecies) stopped. 
Only mind(software) will evolve(intraspecies) now on. Moon expedition is a leap of mind not the body. 


iPhone 12 (kid) (less perfect ) 

modification = (mating with partner having dominant traits) (dominant traits meaning like long height) 
(well red hair is not a dominant traits, these are recessive genes, which means it may look good but most of them are not good survivors, they are prone to diseases more often than dominant genes, well it is mostly psychological)

iPhone 13 (rebirth) (perfect ) 
(minor hardware improvement/ more software features) 

modified (mating) 

iPhone 14 (rebirth) more perfect 
(minor hardware improvement/ more software features) 

You are not here from your birthday, You were always here. 
Just software(mind) got major improvements and minor hardware improvements. 

So the fundamental of the creation is to move towards perfection with time, moving towards equilibrium. This is the same for everything that exists.  

Your evolution in this body
________________________________________________ 
You are now a man. 
But you were a toddler, like a dwarf. 

Before that you were walking with your hands, but you tried to stand on your legs and kept falling like a lion tries to stand a few times. 

Before that you were a boar, using knees and hands to walk. 
Before that you were crawling on your belly like a tortoise. 
Before that you were swimming inside your mother's womb like a fish(sperm). 

Human evolution
________________________________________________ 
So man came from a four legged animal. 
Before that the four legged animal came from the tortoise. 
Before that the tortoise came from a fish. 

Before that algae, bacteria etc. 
And of course the plants. 

So the ocean (water) is compulsory for life to be created. With oxygen hydrogen carbon nitrogen and others. 

My issues with the book origin of species
________________________________________________  
Natural Selection = well book says survival of the fittest, the problem with this argument is that the other species still exists. So I will say it is not in the power of the fittest, the fittest wont wipe out the others like hitler and the USA(hiro, nagasa). 
Like if an asteroid hits, and every creature dies(well you don't know about few of these, they are expert survivors, but let's consider the worst case scenario) so they will come again, the process will repeat, as I said the water is the most important thing for life.

Transitional Fossils = This theory has problems because again let me tell you that nothing has changed except you wearing adidas shoes. 
Life originated in Africa, humans evolved from monkeys, they are just living in ignorance, there is no proof and you wont get any proof.
```

Atman(sanskrit) = Soul/spirit(again these are not precise english words, they don't explain the meaning, I am using it as a western idiom)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Spirit is the quality/information/definition/characteristics/properties of your body/any object. Spirit is not a material whereas your body is material/object. 

Every material has quality and properties that are particular to them and also properties similar to others. 
For example similar properties  you eat, animals also eat, stars also eat. 
Particular properties you can travel to the moon, animals can't. 

Spirit is essential like your abstract, your information, you have love, care, honesty, beauty. These concepts don't exist physically, you have these things even if you are not showing these qualities. 
Ok let me explain further, people think it's stored in the brain. Let's assume you had an accident and got brain injury and you lost your memory, will you act as a violent man now. 
So this information is not fed to you just once when you were a kid, but rather this information is fed to you constantly and always, or you will become a criminal.  

No, you can't become a ghost, there is no such thing as ghosts. There is nothing that will come out of you, when your body dies. 

Of course your body is made of oxygen, water vapor and other elements which will come out but they all are separate from each other, they don't hold the same information anymore, as when you were alive. 

The spirit has no physical connection with your body, it is the meaning of the object. 
```
 
Ways to be immortal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Having a child(passing own body/genetic material) (There is no guarantee that your offspring will be better than you, but still it will get better and better after many births) 

Ancestral = even if you don't have a child you might have brother and sister, they also carry almost the same genetic material. Even more, your mother and father have brothers and sisters and their children. 

Having a major achievement(people that are not your blood relative will become you, they are inspired by your spirit/quality/work) (The problem is someone will replace your work in the future if your work is not ideal and absolute.) 

Attaching your name to the extraordinary person becoming part of the history. (The problem is how will you know who is the extraordinary person of such sophistication.) 
```

Genetics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
If you want to know about women sex organs specifically then, I don't think there are too many differences between men and women, there is only 1 chromosome difference. The man was a woman, that's why they have nipples.  

Female = X chromosome(girl) = 23 chromosomes
Women don't have Y chromosomes, Women don't have ability to control the gender of the new offspring. 

Male = X/Y chromosome = 23/22 chromosomes
Only Men have both X and Y chromosomes. 
So it depends upon male whether he wants a boy or girl to reproduce. The problem is men are very stupid nowadays, they don't know how to control genetics. 

Girl birth = XX
Boy birth = XY
So X is common, that's why men also have nipples. 

If there are things that only girls have, then I can't verify that, personally experience that. That is the only thing in the cosmos that I don't know. 

But I think the extra 23rd chromosome in females holds the information about womb design.
```

Yuj
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Yoga = Yog = Yuj(sanskrit) = join(english) (the sound "uj" means to join/connect can also be found in words like marriage, merge, arrange)
So joining what? of course the cosmos.

Yes, sitting in a studio apartment, wearing skinny spandex pants on a plastic mat is a waste of time.

Physical aspects(asana)
________________________________________________ 
Exercise is necessary but not compulsory, but still the most important thing in the body is breathing and blood circulation and water level, if this is working 90 % of things are good.

Sleep before 11 pm Max, don't sleep in afternoon or you won't be able to sleep at night.(7-8 hours)

Drink water at least 5 liters a day. (My height is 5 ft 9 in, so drink accordingly)

To avoid skin diseases one should take bath at least twice a day.

1st exercise = sun spotting(sun rise)
Eye power loss - the inactiveness of the eye lens, so takeoff your glasses then for 5 minutes every day you have to look and focus at the sun while the sun is red, sunrise and sunset, or moon...not when the sun is white or you will get blind. 
These are the farthest objects. Well watching stars won't help because they are just too far and considered point objects.
And washing eyes and face with cold water at least 5 times a day starting from waking up in the morning or eyes will get damaged.

2nd exercise = Stretching 

3rd exercise = Running 2 km every day

4th exercise = relaxation. 

Martial arts = Rule 1 = It's for defense only. Rule 2 = Learn the Rule 1 first.  

Mental aspects(dhyana)
________________________________________________ 
This is the real game. Yes, reading this list is also Yuj.
```

Mind
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Consciousness(voluntary)                               |          Subconscious (involuntary)      
-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
Free will - choosing a white shirt for today           | Nature's will - what led you to have that shirt in your closet?    
What job do you want to do?                            | You were traveling to the interview location, but somehow the road was blocked, and you couldn't reach it on time.    
Do you have to remember your phone's password?         | Or you just find yourself logged in.     

There is a very thin line here, it is very difficult to understand this concept, pay attention. 

Two people don't see the same thing the same way. 

If I say what is this, you will say it's a tree. Of course it's a tree,  there is no doubt about that. 
But for me everything is atoms, you couldn't see the atoms because you haven't seen an atom. But I can see them like an x-ray. 

So my point is people perceive things differently according to their level of consciousness. 
So what I am doing is enhancing your vision to enable you to see what I see, the broad picture. 
Because if I speak to you in Chinese no matter what secret I tell you, you won't understand a single thing. 

Awake - you are reading this(this is fake, you don't know the reality)
________________________________________________ 
This state consumes a lot of energy, the food you have eaten.

Dreaming - started just before waking up(this one is also fake, you can think whatever you want but it's not true)
________________________________________________ 
This state consumes slightly less energy from the above state.

Deep sleep(complete blankness) - before dreaming(this one is blank, time between sleep and dreaming) 
________________________________________________ 
You can't remember anything, because there is nothing in this state, fully dark.
Saves a lot of body energy. Relaxation state, healing state.

4th state(this one is real only) - there is no 4th state, you are the combination of all these states.
________________________________________________ 
All these states are necessary, 

```

Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
I have never been diagnosed with any disease, if you are vegetarian then you will be fine. 

I had two fractures. I was cycling very fast and fell one evening in class 4 and broke an arm. Then I was running very fast in first year inside the college building and collided with a pillar and broke a finger. It was a curved building. 
Cuts, wounds, burns, shock, accidents - these are just too many instances I don’t remember, well I was an athlete so it’s natural.

No, I didn’t get covid, rather in 2020 I was jumping across a wall and an idiot parked his bicycle there so fell on it, went to the hospital for x-ray and it was fine. 
The doctor is upset that he hasn't seen me for 6 years now.
